This is a project I was tasked to create that will act as a study tool for students.
The user should be able to study a deck of flashcards, as well as create new decks, update the deck names and descriptions, delete decks, add and delete cards from the decks, edit cards, and view the entire deck.
I was tasked with creating the code for the frontend aspect of this project.

For this project, I used React, React Router, hooks, and debugged the REact code through console output and using the VS Code debugger.
I hope to be able to use my own project in the future to study for the software engineering program.
